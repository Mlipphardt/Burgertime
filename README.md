# Burgertime

Burgertime is an app to simulate the experience of creating a unique grilled creation and subsequently eating it. 

Upon visiting the webpage, users are presented with a list of every burger created. When first created, a burger will appear in the list on the left-hand side accompanied by a button labeled "devour."

If pressed, the "devour" button will move its associated burger to the right-hand side in the "devoured" column.

This app is currently being hosted at Heroku.com
